This app took 2nd place at UMSL's 2018 Hackathon.

The theme of the 2018 UMSL Hackathon was "Got api?". Conestants
were tasked with harnessing the power of api in a final product.
Our team chose to use the IBMWatson and RapidAPI api's to create
a mobile app that uses image recognition to generate search keys
from photos of food, and return a list of recipes associated with
those ingredients.
